# Tic-Tac-Toe

To get started:

`git clone https://github.com/spencerudnick/tic-tac-toe.git`

`cd tic-tac-toe`

`npm install`

`npm start`

The app includes some React components, but so far doesn't work at all.

Your task is to write the functionality of the app, filling in the provided components and functions.

Good luck!
